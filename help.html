    <h3>How to play Simon:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Start the Game:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Press START to start.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><b>Watch the Sequence:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The game will light up one of its four colored buttons (red, green, blue, yellow) 
                and play a corresponding tone. Watch and listen carefully.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><b>Repeat the Sequence:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Press the same button that light up. If it started with red, press the red button.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><b>Follow the Pattern:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The game will then repeat the first light and add another one to the sequence. For example,
                 if the first light was red, the next might be green. You should now press red, then green.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><b>Continue Repeating:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>Each round, the game will add one more light to the sequence. Continue pressing the
                 buttons in the exact order they lightt up.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><b>Stay Focused:</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>If you press the wrong button, the game will make a buzz sound, and the
                 game is over. Try to remember the sequence correctly each time.</li>
        </ul>

        <li><b>Advance to Higher Levels:</b></li>
        <ul><li>As you progress, the sequences will get longer and more challenging.
             Try to see how far you can go without making a mistake.</li></ul>

        <li><b>Winning the Game:</b></li>
        <ul><li>The game typically has a set number of sequences you need to remember to win.
             If you successfully repeat all the sequences, you win!</li></ul>
    </ol>
